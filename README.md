# Defect Detector
A simple Python script for automated visual quality control that uses OpenCV to compare test images against a "golden reference" image. It automatically detects and classifies common manufacturing defects such as FLASH (excess material) and CUT (missing material), highlighting them on the image for review.

Working:

1. Focus on the Shape (cv2.threshold) üé®
First, we simplify the image into a pure black-and-white shadow to focus only on the object's exact shape. This process, known as Binarization, is done using the OpenCV function cv2.threshold.

2. Spot the Difference (cv2.bitwise_xor) üîç
Next, we digitally compare the two shapes to see where they don't match. This Image Differencing is done with cv2.bitwise_xor, which marks any pixel that is different between the two images, creating a "difference map."

3. Outline Each Flaw (cv2.findContours) ‚úèÔ∏è
Instead of seeing the differences as one big blob, we need to find the outline of each individual flaw. The function cv2.findContours does this for us, acting like a digital pencil that traces around each separate white shape on our difference map.

4. Decide: Extra or Missing? (Classification Logic) ‚öñÔ∏è
Finally, for each outlined flaw, the script analyzes the area to decide if it's extra material or a missing piece. This decision, a simple form of Classification, is the custom "brain" of our script that labels the flaw as Flash or Cut.
